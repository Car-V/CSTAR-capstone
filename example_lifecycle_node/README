This is an example lifecycle ROS2 node.
Ideally we will use one lifecycle node for each subsystem.
Possible Workflow:
1. Power robot on
2. lifecycle manager initializes all nodes to unconfigured
3. nodes transition to innactive during setup phase
4. User starts robot
    - nodes transition to active in a specific order:
        1. LiDAR node starts SLAM
        2. Motor drive node starts moving
        3. Audio processing begins

5. Case where WiFi drops:
    - Nodes transition to inactive, preserving state and waiting for reconnection
6. Reconnection occurs:
    - Nodes resume Active state and continue tasks.

--> this can cover more edge cases and errors such as the ones we laid out when doing our state machine.

Each subsystems lifecycle nodes will be more advanced and will have transition logic and error handling. They can also call on other scripts and functions in each respective state.
